Without using prebuilt linear model functions, I derive multiple regression terms using matrix multiplication

Based on work produced by Charles Zaiontz and his blog http://www.real-statistics.com/free-download/ as well as Applied Regression Modeling by Iain Pardoe

Y column is the 2nd column (in this dataset, the 1st column is removed.  Which might make it confusing for someone who wants to repurpose this, but all you have to do then is read.csv into data and the 1st column will be Y)
